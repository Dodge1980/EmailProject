# EmailProject
We have all received messages, specifically, emails supposedly from friends or contacts that are in fact spam either falsely sent in their name, or sent from their account after hacking into it. This project would involve designing and implementing a system that would prevent such messages being accepted by the recipient's messaging service, through use of automated digital signatures. The project will involve investigating digital signature systems and methods for verifying the user is present at a terminal when sending their message such as Bluetooth LE or biometrics and designing a coherent system to use such technologies to sign outgoing messages in a user-friendly way.
